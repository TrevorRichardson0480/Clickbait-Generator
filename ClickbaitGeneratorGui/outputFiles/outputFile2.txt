The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 finally shows the one and only, Boba Fett in the spotlight. We see Boba return and eventually help Din Djarin and Grogu against Moff Gideon's Storm Troopers and Dark Troopers (phase 2 I think), who end up taking Grogu.\nFennec Shand reminds me a lot of Zam Wessel from Attack of the Clones, who was pursued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, until Jango showed up.\n\nWe also learn a lot about Jango Fett, Boba Fett's Father. We learn that Jango Fett was a Mandalorian! This is awesome! Since it was skewed in canon, it's nice to know we finally have an answer. They seem to be following his story from Open Seasons comic book series which shows the story of Jango as a boy. Long story short, Jango was the son of a farmer on Concord Dawn. A man named Jaster Mereel who was leader of the True Mandalorians, was on the run from a traitor named Tor Vizsla from Death Watch. Jangos dad hid Jaster Mereel in his farm, and told Jango that he was feeding some homeless men. When Tor Vizsla came looking near Jangos Dads farm, he found Jangos Dad and beat him up infant of Jango, until Jangos mom created a distraction and Jango ran for his life, leaving his parents who were immediately murdered, Fett ran into Jaster Mereel who eventually took the boy under his wing and recruited him in the Mandalorian Civil War against Death Watch, as one of the True Mandalorians. Jaster died eventually and Jango avenged him, becoming the leader of the True Mandalorians. Now the people who found Din, were death watch, so the two clans have always been waging wars against one another and have varying beliefs. \n\nExplaining this to Din, Din accepts that the armour belongs to Boba. So this armour, is just repainted from his dads, from Jangos. The deal is done, says Din, where Boba assures him that it is not, as he promised the safety of the child in return for his armour. Now Boba joins the crew until the child is safe. Flying in the Slave 1, they arrive on Nevarro 7, where Cara Dune is now a New Republic Marshal, where he asks her to locate Mayfeld, who you might remember from season 1. Mando is going to spring him out of jail to locate Moff Gideons cruiser.\n\nWe jump to Moff Gideons light cruiser, he walks to the cell containing the child.\n\nAs Moff Gideon enters, we see Grogu using the force on stormtroopers. Even going as far as using force choke, to which many might think is a dark side move, but, I should mention, Luke Skywalker used it as well in Return of the Jedi, and he was far from the dark side.\n\nAs Grogu knocks them out, Gideon steps up to him and ignites his \ndark saber, asking Grogu if he remembers one of these, meaning if he remembers using a lightsaber or having seen many lightsabers during his time as a Jedi at the Jedi Temple before Order 66. Grogu is tired, I think because he had to cut himself off from the force for so long that he isnt used to using it as much as when he was at the Jedi temple learning from the many masters. Using the force can also tire one out, like it does to Luke in the empire strikes back when failing to lift the x-wing out of Yodas swamp. They blast Grogu with a stun blast, and cuff him. Gideon tells his officer to contact Dr. Pershing, the cloning doctor responsible for the experiments on the child, to tell him that they have their donor. The plan now is for Gideon to kill Grogu to harvest all of his blood which has force powers, or in Star Wars lingo, a high Midichlorian count. End of the episode.\n\nIt was amazing. Simply amazing. My favourite episode of the entire show so far, which is saying a lot. Boba is back and badder than ever, as Terry Silver would say. I think the next episode will revolve around rescuing Mayfeld from Jail, and then tracking the light cruiser or going to Dr. Pershing who will have the child momentarily. I think the season finale will end in a Big Bang all out battle like end game. With everyone weve seen from this season fighting together against Moff Gideon and his dark troopers, as he himself gets in a phase 3 dark trooper mega suit to destroy Din. Hopefully Ahsoka Tano returns with Bo Katan, and we get to see another Jedi, Luke or Ezra is my guess.\n\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join", 'thumbnails': {'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qOUTjn2lVO8/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qOUTjn2lVO8/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qOUTjn2lVO8/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'standard': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qOUTjn2lVO8/sddefault.jpg', 'width': 640, 'height': 480}, 'maxres': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qOUTjn2lVO8/maxresdefault.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}}, 'channelTitle': 'Star Wars Theory', 'tags': ['the mandalorian', 'star wars', 'baby yoda', 'mandalorian season 2', 'ahsoka tano', 'the mandalorian season 2', 'the child', 'disney plus', 'boba fett', 'mandalorian ahsoka', 'the mandalorian season 2 episode 6', 'rosario dawson', 'moff gideon', 'dave filoni', 'grand admiral thrawn', 'star wars explained', 'star wars theory', 'the mandalorian reaction', 'jon favreau', 'bo katan', 'boba fett the mandalorian', 'jango fett', 'vader vs ahsoka', 'ahsoka mandalorian', 'dark troopers', 'luke skywalker the mandalorian', 'jedi'], 'categoryId': '24', 'liveBroadcastContent': 'none', 'defaultLanguage': 'en', 'localized': {'title': 'The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 Breakdown OH MY GOD', 'description': "This episode had it all!
